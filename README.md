# Why did I build this?
This is a work-in-progress learning project which came to mind at just the right time to serve many purposes:
 
* I knew the concept was doable and was excited by the exercise of figuring out the math/geometry. What they don't tell you in college is that software engineers don't often get to use the hard-earned knowledge gained in required math courses. So the first iteration of this project was a little bit of Python code running on [replit.com](https://repl.it/@mkazin/Subnautica-plot) which scratched that itch and gave me a map to use at playtime. It's awful code and contains spoilers- you've been warned.
* I've never done any serious web development, certainly not building something from scratch. This was a good opportunity to build something not insignificant, utilizing what I've learned while mentoring students at [Resilient Coders](https://www.resilientcoders.org/bootcamp) who are learning full-stack development. BTW- hire its graduates! They're amazing.
* There are a lot of aspects of Python that I have yet to learn, such as building a Flask API, which is used in this project.
* I've been reading through Uncle Bob's [Clean Code](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Code-A-Handbook-of-Agile-Software-Craftsmanship/PGM63937.html) and wanted to practice some of the material there.
* [Subnautica: Below Zero](https://store.steampowered.com/app/848450/Subnautica_Below_Zero/) was approaching its release date and I was enjoying it in Early Access. Being a big fan of the first game who fully expects to go back, this seemed useful to me and others.
